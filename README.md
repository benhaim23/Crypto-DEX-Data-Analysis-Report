# Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Trading Analysis Across Multiple Chains

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the analysis of trading volumes and liquidity across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on different blockchains, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. The project utilizes historical trading data to derive insights into the dynamics of cryptocurrency trading on these platforms, aiming to identify trends, behaviors, and opportunities within the DeFi space.

## Project Organization
`README.md` - The top-level README for developers and analysts using this project.

`DEX Data Analysis Report Across Chains.py` - Detailed analysis of DEX trading statistics with aggregated data of several blockchains with an interactive dashboard showcasing visualizations of dex statistics across chains.

`Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Trading Volumes and Liquidity by Chains.py` - Comparative analysis and an interactive dashboard for real-time data visualization by each chain respectively.

## Data Dictionary
The project involves the following datasets, with each dataset containing fields such as daily, weekly, and monthly trading volumes, USD liquidity, and transaction counts:

- Ethereum (ETH) Trading Data
- Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Trading Data
- Solana (SOL) Trading Data
- Polygon (MATIC) Trading Data
- Arbitrum (ARB) Trading Data
- Optimism (OP) Trading Data

## Data Sources
Data for this project is sourced from various blockchain APIs and third-party DEX analytics services. The raw data is processed and stored in CSV format for analysis.


## Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Install the required Python libraries in bash using:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn dash jupyter-dash

## Usage

To run the analysis scripts:

python DEX Data Analysis Report by Chain.py
python Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Trading Volumes and Liquidity Across Chains.py

## Interactive Dashboard

The dashboards provide real-time insights into DEX trading volumes and liquidity. It features interactive charts and graphs that allow users to explore data across different time frames and blockchains.
